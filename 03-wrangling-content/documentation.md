# Documentation
- `LO4` - Students should be able to write concise documentation of data cleaning steps (and/or next steps)
- `LO5` - Students should be able to identify appropriate tools for 'data wrangling' and explain the purpose of the tools

Documentation is really an extension of understanding, or a tool that will help your future self and others understand what has been done. In early stages of a data project, documentation can also help you keep track of important information, next steps, or new ideas.

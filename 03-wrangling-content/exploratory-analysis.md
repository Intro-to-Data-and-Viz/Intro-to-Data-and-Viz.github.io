# Exploratory Analysis

- `LO1` – Students should be able to assess a novel dataset for errors and/or anomalies using Tableau and develop a plan to address the found issues
- `LO2` – Students should be able to create an exploratory Tableau Workbook or Jupyter Notebook for a new dataset that will help with their understanding of the data
- `LO5` - Students should be able to identify appropriate tools for 'data wrangling' and explain the purpose of the tools


When you first gain access to a new dataset, you will want often want to being by exploring the data. So far, we have introduced two tools that can be helpful with this: Jupyter and Tableau. There are benefits and drawbacks to each, and you may find yourself using both rather than picking one or the other. 
 
### 🛠 Tools
- Tableau
- Jupyter/Python

### ☑️ Tasks
- Review **the exploratory analysis template notebook** (link) 
- Import your dataset into a the template
- Import your dataset into **the tableau template** and try to mimic the tasks from the Jupyter Notebook template

### Optional Submissions
- Submit your data transformation Jupyter Notebook to GitHub Classroom: [Moodle Submission- Data Wrangling GitHub Classroom](https://moodle.met.ubc.ca/mod/lti/view.php?id=1460)

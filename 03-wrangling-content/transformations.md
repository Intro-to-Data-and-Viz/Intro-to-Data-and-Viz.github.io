# Transformations
- `LO3` – Students should demonstrate the ability to adapt a given Jupyter Notebook to transform a novel dataset 
- `LO5` - Students should be able to identify appropriate tools for 'data wrangling' and explain the purpose of the tools  

Once you have a handle on your data, and are starting to understand the changes that need to be made - you can start transforming the data. 

### 🛠 Tools
- Python / Jupyter

### 📚 Resources
- [Learn how to use the Transform Function in Pandas (with Python Code)](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/03/understanding-transform-function-python/)
- [Filtering Data with Pandas .query() Method](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-filtering-data-with-pandas-query-method/)
- [Alternatives to Pandas](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-data-transformation-tools-for-etl-2cb20d76fcd0)
  
### ☑️ Tasks
- Adapt the transformations jupyter notebook for your dataset to clean and create summary tables
- Review building a Jupyter Notebook for data transformations:

# Transformations
- `LO3` – Students should demonstrate the ability to adapt a given Jupyter Notebook to transform a novel dataset 
- `LO5` - Students should be able to identify appropriate tools for 'data wrangling' and explain the purpose of the tools  

Once you have a handle on your data, and are starting to understand the changes that need to be made - you can start transforming the data. 

### 🛠 Tools

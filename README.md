## Introduction to Data Analytics and Visualization

The course is designed to introduce you to data analytics and visualization by covering a few main topics:

**Tools**: the tools introduced will be used to complete projects for the course topics.
**Accessing Data**: this topic will introduce you to many common ways of accessing data, and considerations to be made when doing so.
**Data Wrangling**: we will discuss common data wrangling issues, share some tools for completing some of the common tasks using python, and begin to think about documentation of our data.
**Data Visualization**: we ultimately want to tell a story about our data, or improve the audience understanding. We will introduce some basic principles of data visualization, give some demonstration about how to use Tableau, and discuss common chart types and their purpose.   

## Learning Objectives

`LO1`: The student should be able to identify appropriate tools for basic analytics tasks: data cleaning/manipulation, data exploration, data analysis, and data visualization. 

`LO2`: Given a new dataset, the student should demonstrate the ability to explore the data in order to understand the data, identify issues with consistency/cleanliness, and begin to document possible solutions for data transformations.

`LO3`: The student should be able to choose appropriate chart types given various data types. The student should be able to explain why these are appropriate chart types. 

`LO4`: The student should demonstrate basic familiarity with the three main tools in this course: GitHub, Python, and Tableau. 
## Audience

This introductory course is for anyone interested in learning more about the field of analytics. This course will introduce general knowledge about the main concepts, and use a number of tools common in the field: GitHub, Python, and Tableau. The participants in this course should have a very basic understanding of programming concepts, and have had some (even if only a little) experience programming in any language. The programming language is not important, as long as they are comfortable picking up a new language (in this case Python). 

## Instructor Role

This course is meant to be a combination of fully online self-paced, it will also include supplementary materials (Companion Website, GitHub repos) that would act as a refresher before or after the course, or introduce some more advanced topics once the course is complete. 

The instructor will be there to support students through discussion forums, email, and by providing feedback to the assignments that are submitted with each topic. The instructor will also be there to encourage peer interaction and community development. 

## Course Design

### Structure
The topics are standalone and can be completed in any order. Each topic will contain content, a project, and a self-assessment quiz. The content will provide enough information and demonstrations to complete the project. The self-assessment quiz will focus on understanding of concepts. These standalone topics allow not only self-pacing but flexibility of focus based on the interest of the learner. All of the topics will be integrated in the culminating project, but there is no prescribed order necessary for learning about each topic. 

### LMS / External Tools
There are two main external resources for this course: the Companion Website, and the website/tool GitHub.  Any assessed material can be submitted through GitHub Classroom which is integrated with the LMS to maintain student privacy and security. Any contributions to external tools (that are not integrated) is up to the discretion of the student. For example, GitHub could act as a project / portfolio space for the students, where they can look back on their work, and can be set as a private or public portfolio.

The use of the LMS for assessment and communication allows instructor feedback, and community discussions to take place in a secure environment. 

### Companion Website 
The use of an embedded website for course content, video tutorials, and other material allows the course to be an ongoing resource for students, even if they are not officially registered. 

The website also demonstrates good practice for publicly facing information and design which is an important thing to consider in the world of data and analytics. Moodle is quite constrained in some of the design choices, so the use of a companion website can improve the student experience through the use of customizable design. 

There should be no student privacy or security risks in the website itself - there are no analytics, and there should be minimal external links. There is a risk of error in embedding the content, or because the website is hosted outside of the LMS. However, that risk is minimal and could be rectified by sharing the content of the website as a downloadable file. This is possible in this case, because the website is public, available on GitHub, and could be downloaded or shared as a zip file.

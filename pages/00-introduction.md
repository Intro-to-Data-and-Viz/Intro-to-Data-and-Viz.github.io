### Companion Website
This content is designed to accompany "Introduction to Data Analytics and Visualization" - the course. It is important to us that the material be available once the course is complete - as a living / growing resource that you can refer back to, even once you are no longer enrolled. 

The content in the website includes a "checklist" for you to keep track of your progress / or to track what content you would like to review. 

There is also an option for contributing posts - which will act as mini-lessons, tutorials, or reference documentation developed by members of this class. 

### Assessments
The assessments in this course are of three types: a final Project [image], GitHub Classroom submission [image here], and quizzes [image]. Each main topic will have an accompanying quiz and github submission, and there will be a single final project. 
#### GitHub Classroom
This course has been integrated with GitHub Classroom to allow you to securely submit various pieces of work, provide automatic feedback, and not have to worry about posting your work publicly (yet). GitHub Classroom is also an opportunity to practice your Git/GitHub skills! 
#### Quizzes
The quizzes are aimed to provide you an opportunity to check your own knowledge. They are designed in a way to test what you know and provide feedback for what to review based on your responses.

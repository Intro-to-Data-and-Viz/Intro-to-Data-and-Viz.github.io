## Overview

The course is designed to introduce you to data analytics and visualization by covering a few main topics:

**Tools**: the tools introduced will be used to complete projects for the course topics.
**Accessing Data**: this topic will introduce you to many common ways of accessing data, and considerations to be made when doing so.
**Data Wrangling**: we will discuss common data wrangling issues, share some tools for completing some of the common tasks using python, and begin to think about documentation of our data.
**Data Visualization**: we ultimately want to tell a story about our data, or improve the audience understanding. We will introduce some basic principles of data visualization, give some demonstration about how to use Tableau, and discuss common chart types and their purpose. 

- There *are* suggested prerequisites for this course - students can take the "Are you ready for this course?" questionnaire to review necessary skills/knowledge to get the most out of this course

### Course Learning Objectives
`LO1`: The student should be able to identify appropriate tools for basic analytics tasks: data cleaning/manipulation, data exploration, data analysis, and data visualization. 

`LO2`: Given a new dataset, the student should demonstrate the ability to explore the data in order to understand the data, identify issues with consistency/cleanliness, and begin to document possible solutions for data transformations.

`LO3`: The student should be able to choose appropriate chart types given various data types. The student should be able to explain why these are appropriate chart types. 

`LO4`: The student should demonstrate basic familiarity with the three main tools in this course: GitHub, Python, and Tableau.

### Companion Website
This content is designed to accompany "Introduction to Data Analytics and Visualization" - the course. It is important to us that the material be available once the course is complete - as a living / growing resource that you can refer back to, even once you are no longer enrolled. 

The content in the website includes a "checklist" for you to keep track of your progress / or to track what content you would like to review. 

There is also an option for contributing posts - which will act as mini-lessons, tutorials, or reference documentation developed by members of this class.

Data "Wrangling" is often seen as the preliminary step of any data project, however, you will find the more you work with various data sets, that you will often find yourself "wrangling" all the way through. 

To get the most of the Data Wrangling section, we recommend reviewing "Getting Ready" to make sure you have GitHub, Tableau, and Python/Jupyter installed and ready to go. #COMMUNICATION POINT#

- `LO1` – Students should be able to assess a novel dataset for errors and/or anomalies using Tableau and develop a plan to address the found issues
- `LO2` – Students should be able to create an exploratory Tableau Workbook or Jupyter Notebook for a new dataset that will help with their understanding of the data
- `LO3` – Students should demonstrate the ability to adapt a given Jupyter Notebook to transform a novel dataset 
- `LO4` - Students should be able to write concise documentation of data cleaning steps (and/or next steps)
- `LO5` - Students should be able to identify appropriate tools for 'data wrangling' and explain the purpose of the tools

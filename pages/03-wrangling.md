Data "Wrangling" is often seen as the preliminary step of any data project, however, you will find the more you work with various data sets, that you will often find yourself "wrangling" all the way through. 

To get the most of the Data Wrangling section, we recommend reviewing "Getting Ready" to make sure you have GitHub, Tableau, and Python/Jupyter installed and ready to go. #COMMUNICATION POINT#

- `LO1` – Students should be able to assess a novel dataset for errors and/or anomalies using Tableau and develop a plan to address the found issues
- `LO2` – Students should demonstrate the ability to adapt a given Jupyter Notebook to transform a novel dataset 
- `LO3` – Students should be able to create an exploratory Tableau Workbook or Jupyter Notebook for a new dataset that will help with their understanding of the data
- `LO4` - Students should be able to write concise documentation of data cleaning steps (and/or next steps)
- `LO5` - Students should be able to identify appropriate tools / python packages for 'data wrangling' and explain the purpose of the tools

## Exploratory Analysis

When you first gain access to a new dataset, you will want often want to being by exploring the data. So far, we have introduced two tools that can be helpful with this: Jupyter and Tableau. There are benefits and drawbacks to each, and you may find yourself using both rather than picking one or the other. 

### 🛠 Tools
- Tableau
- Jupyter/Python

### 📚 Readings
- [Better, Faster, Stronger Python Exploratory Data Analysis](https://towardsdatascience.com/better-faster-stronger-python-exploratory-data-analysis-eda-e2a733890a64)
- [Tableau for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://towardsdatascience.com/tableau-for-exploratory-data-analysis-eda-c503aa84515a)
  
### ☑️ Tasks
- Review **TEMPLATE_NOTEBOOK** 
- Import **new_dataset** into a Jupyter Notebook using **OUR_TEMPLATE**
- Import **new_dataset** into Tableau and try to mimic the tasks from the Jupyter Notebook **TEMPLATE**

## Transformations

Once you have a handle on your data, and are starting to understand the changes that need to be made - you can start transforming the data. 

### 🛠 Tools
- Python / Jupyter

### 📚 Readings
- [Learn how to use the Transform Function in Pandas (with Python Code)](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/03/understanding-transform-function-python/)
- [Filtering Data with Pandas .query() Method](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-filtering-data-with-pandas-query-method/)
- [Alternatives to Pandas](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-data-transformation-tools-for-etl-2cb20d76fcd0)
  
### ☑️ Tasks
## Understanding

This should be understanding of
- the data
- the problem
- your process so far
- the client's needs 


### 🛠 Tools
- Your Choice

### 📚 Readings
- N/A

### ☑️ Tasks
- Review **client requirements** for **new_dataset**
- Write a list of questions based upon the client requirements and your exploration so far
- **Post** your list of questions [Moodle: Discussion for Data Wrangling](https://moodle.met.ubc.ca/mod/forum/view.php?id=1251)
  
## Documentation

Documentation is really an extension of understanding, or a tool that will help your future self and others understand what has been done. In early stages of a data project, documentation can also help you keep track of important information, next steps, or new ideas.

### 🛠 Tools
- Your Choice
  
### 📚 Readings
- [Data Dictionaries](https://www.usgs.gov/products/data-and-tools/data-management/data-dictionaries)
  
### ☑️ Tasks
- Write a data dictionary based upon your exploration, transformations, and questions
- **Post** your dictionary to [Moodle: The Course Repo](https://moodle.met.ubc.ca/mod/lti/view.php?id=1252) and compare with classmates
- Add definitions to [Moodle: The Course Term Database](https://moodle.met.ubc.ca/mod/data/field.php?d=3)

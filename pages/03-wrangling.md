Data "Wrangling" is often seen as the preliminary step of any data project, however, you will find the more you work with various data sets, that you will often find yourself "wrangling" all the way through. 

To get the most of the Data Wrangling section, we recommend reviewing "Getting Ready" to make sure you have GitHub, Tableau, and Python/Jupyter installed and ready to go. #COMMUNICATION POINT#

- `LO1` – Students should be able to assess a novel dataset for errors and/or anomalies using Tableau and develop a plan to address the found issues
- `LO2` – Students should be able to create an exploratory Tableau Workbook or Jupyter Notebook for a new dataset that will help with their understanding of the data
- `LO3` – Students should demonstrate the ability to adapt a given Jupyter Notebook to transform a novel dataset 
- `LO4` - Students should be able to write concise documentation of data cleaning steps (and/or next steps)
- `LO5` - Students should be able to identify appropriate tools for 'data wrangling' and explain the purpose of the tools

In this unit there are four sections. Each section has a list of suggested resources, a template Jupyter Notebook and/or Tableau workbook to demonstrate the skills you will be learning, and a list of tasks to complete. You can choose to submit **one** complete Tableau Workbook or Jupyter Notebook from a section for evaluation and personal feedback. All other submitted items will be auto-graded for correctness but will not include detailed feedback. 

The deadline for submission for feedback is: **end of month**. 


# [Exploratory Analysis](https://intro-to-data-and-viz.github.io/wrangling/exploratory-analysis)
> When you first gain access to a new dataset, you will want often want to being by exploring the data. So far, we have introduced two tools that can be helpful with this: Jupyter and Tableau. There are benefits and drawbacks to each, and you may find yourself using both rather than picking one or the other. 
# [Transformations](https://intro-to-data-and-viz.github.io/wrangling/transformations)
> Once you have a handle on your data, and are starting to understand the changes that need to be made - you can start transforming the data. 

# [Understanding](https://intro-to-data-and-viz.github.io/wrangling/understanding)
> This should be understanding of
- the data
- the problem
- your process so far
- the client's needs 

# [Documentation](https://intro-to-data-and-viz.github.io/wrangling/documentation)
> Documentation is really an extension of understanding, or a tool that will help your future self and others understand what has been done. In early stages of a data project, documentation can also help you keep track of important information, next steps, or new ideas.

# Additional Resources

Here you will find "quick resources". These resources are short, one-question posts contributed by anyone! They act as quick tutorials and an opportunity to contribute to the course. They may have  been written by current or former participants in the Moodle course, TAs or instructors. 

## Contribute

You are welcome to contribute posts to this website - write your post, create a pull request, and after review it will be added. This is a great chance to practice your storytelling, write clear documentation, or share with current / future / past classes. We have a sample post available with suggested formatting to follow.
